## NLP Levels
- Speech$\rightarrow$Phonetic/Phonological Analysis  or  Text$\rightarrow$OCR/Tokenization
- Morphological analysis
- Syntactic analysis
- Semantic Interpretation
- Discourse Processing

A human language is a system specially constructed to convey the speaker/writer's meaning.
  - Not just an environmental signal, it's a deliberate conmunication
  - Using an encoding which little kids can easily learn

A human language is a discrate/symbolic/categorical signaling system
  - With very minor exceptions for expressive signaling
  - Presumably because of greater signaling reliability
  - Symbols are not just an invetion of logic / classical AI!

The categorical symbols of a language can be encoded as a signal for communication in several ways:
  - Sound
  - Gesture
  - Images(writing)

The symbol is invariant across different encodings!

A brain encoding appears to be a continuous pattern of activation, the symbols are transmitted via continuous signals of sound and vision

## What is DL?
- a subfield of machine learning
- Machine Learning becomes just optimizing weights to best make a final prediction
- Representation learning attempts to aotomatically learn good features or representations
- Deep Learning algorithms attempt to learn (multiple levels of) representation and an output
- From "raw" inputs * (eg., sound, characters, or words)

## NLP is hard
- Complexity in representing, learning and using linguistic/situational/world/visual knowledge
- Human languages are ambiguous (thus we get the efficiency)
- Human language interpretation depends on real world, common sense, and contextual knowledge

1. The Pope's baby steps on gays
2. Boy paralyzed after tumor fights back to gain black belt
3. Scientists study from whales from space
4. Juvenile Court Try Shooting Defendant

## Deep NLP = Deep Learning + NLP
Combine ideas and goals of NLP with using representation learning and deep learning to solve them

Several big improvements in recent years in NLP with different
- Levels: speech, words, syntax, semantics
- Tools: parts-of-speech, entities, parsing
- Applications: machine translation, sentiment analysis, dialogue agents, question answering
